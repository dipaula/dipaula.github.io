    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>S. DiPaula &amp; Sons Seafood, Inc. was established as a sole proprietorship     in 1897 by Salvatore DiPaula. The original location at 421-23 E. Lexington     Street was a restaurant which fed many of the firemen during the great Baltimore fire of 1904.</p>
    <p>In 1917, the business moved to 505 Forrest Street and became a wholesale and retail dealer throughout central Maryland. While at the location the business went through three changes of business organization. It became a partnership managed by George and Andrew DiPaula, sons of the founder. Next, the company went back to a sole proprietorship after Georgeâ€™s death. Then in late December 1964 after the death of Andrew Jackson DiPaula, his only child Rosemary DiPaula Schisler and her husband Thomas Edward Schisler, Sr. inherited the business.</p>
    <p>In the fall of 1972, the company moved to its third and current location, 7613 Philadelphia Road in Rosedale, Maryland. The company added a produce line to compliment its seafood line in 1979. In 1987, the business changed  its organization  into a corporatism and changed its name to S. DiPaula &amp; Sons Seafood, Inc., Wholesale and Retail Seafood and Produce Distributors.</p>
